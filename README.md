# Bartlomiej Bykowy  
**Frontend Engineer - Architecture / React / TypeScript / Design System / Testing**

I'm an engineer with 9+ years of experience building large-scale web applications across both agency-style and product-driven environments.

My core expertise lies in JavaScript and the React ecosystem, but I operate as a product-minded engineer - focusing on scalable architecture, performance, developer experience, and long-term maintainability.

I’ve worked on customer-facing platforms, internal systems used across multiple teams, and microfrontend architectures requiring cross-domain coordination.
